🚗 Tesla Global Delivery Analytics (2015–2025)

📌 Tesla Global Delivery Analytics is a Power BI–based project that analyzes Tesla’s global vehicle deliveries from 2015 to 2025, transforming large-scale production and delivery data into actionable business insights using interactive dashboards, forecasting, and anomaly detection.

➡️ The project focuses on understanding delivery trends, model-wise and region-wise performance, infrastructure impact, operational efficiency, and future demand to support data-driven decision-making in the electric vehicle ecosystem.

📁 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nalisha/tesla-ea-deliveries-and-production-data20152025) and includes Tesla’s delivery, production, model, regional, pricing, infrastructure, and sustainability data spanning 2015–2025.

🎯 Project Objectives
Analyze global delivery trends, evaluate model and regional performance, assess charging infrastructure impact, identify production–delivery gaps, detect anomalies, and forecast future deliveries.

📊 Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard serves as an interactive decision-support system with drill-through pages, custom tooltips, slicers, KPI cards, and predictive visuals for dynamic exploration of Tesla’s performance.
